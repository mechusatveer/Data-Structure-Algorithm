1) You have n requests from different people to book a room
    In a year think days are 0-364
    Req1  3-7 mean i want to book a room from day 3 to day 7
    Req2  2-19 mean i want to book a room from day 2 to day 19
    Req3  5-7 mean i want to book a room from day 5 to day 7

   Now all request cannot be processed
   We want 

  1) How many max request can be processsed
  2) How much max rent we can get it mean how many max days u can keep your room busy

  request cannot accepted partial

 1-2
 3-4
 1-5

 Here how many max request we can process - 2  1-2 & 3-4
But how many max days we can keep busy this room is 1-5 and in that case only 1 req be processed.

Any doubt drop a mail to me

2) You are school teacher, u have your n students
    You have one array of their marks and all these n students are in a queu
    Then can know marks of next and prev student
    
    Now condition is u need to distribute sweets between these students
    If a student have more marks then any neighbour he want more sweets than that neighbour

    Note:- we not say equal
    3 4 4
    1 2 1 its ok 
     3rd cannot say why i not get two bcoz he not have more marks 

    Simply say you can make a argument if you have more marks than your neighbour

   Now we need to distrubite sweets such a way 
   So no argument happen there
   and sweets used be less.
